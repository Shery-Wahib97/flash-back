 MY FINAL PROJECT 
A one or two sentence description of your project here. 
- What does it do?   
  "This is a web project that serves as a digital memory library where users can register, log in, and store their memories with images, titles, descriptions, and dates. Users can also edit or delete their memories as needed and the project allows users to save, manage, and display their memories using a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system implemented with Flask for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend."
  
- What is the "new feature" which you have implemented that 
we haven't seen before?   
  "The project includes an image upload feature with file validation, allowing users to attach multiple images to their memories. Additionally, it uses session-based authentication to maintain user logins and securely manage user data."
## Prerequisites 
Did you add any additional modules that someone needs to 
install (for instance anything in Python that you `pip 
install-ed`)?  
  Flask
  Flask-CORS
  Json
## Project Checklist 
- [✅] It is available on GitHub. 
- [✅] It uses the Flask web framework. 
- [✅] It uses at least one module from the Python Standard 
Library other than the random module. 
  Please provide the name of the module you are using in your 
app. 
  - Module name: os
- [✅] It contains at least one class written by you that has 
both properties and methods. It uses `__init__()` to let the 
class initialize the object's attributes (note that  
`__init__()` doesn't count as a method). This includes 
instantiating the class and using the methods in your app. 
Please provide below the file name and the line number(s) of 
at least one example of a class definition in your code as 
well as the names of two properties and two methods. 
  - File name for the class definition: users.py
  - Line number(s) for the class definition: Line 4
  - Name of two properties: user_file_path, allowed_extensions
  - Name of two methods: load_users(), save_users()
  - File name and line numbers where the methods are used:
    . load_users() → Used in app.py (Lines 24, 57, 95)
    . save_users() → Used in app.py (Lines 108, 227, 285)
- [✅] It makes use of JavaScript in the front end and uses the 
localStorage of the web browser. 
- [✅] It uses modern JavaScript (for example, let and const 
rather than var). 
- [✅] It makes use of the reading and writing to the same file 
feature. 
- [✅] It contains conditional statements.
  one example of a conditional statement in your code. 
  - File name:  app.py
  - Line number(s):  58, 95, 126, 192
- [✅] It contains loops. Please provide below the file name 
and the line number(s) of at least 
  one example of a loop in your code. 
  - File name: app.py
  - Line number(s): 57, 94, 128
- [✅] It lets the user enter a value in a text box at some 
point. 
  This value is received and processed by your back end 
Python code. 
- [✅] It doesn't generate any error message even if the user 
enters a wrong input. 
- [✅] It is styled using your own CSS. 
- [✅] The code follows the code and style conventions as 
introduced in the course, is fully documented using comments 
and doesn't contain unused or experimental code.  
  In particular, the code should not use `print()` or 
`console.log()` for any information the app user should see. 
Instead, all user feedback needs to be visible in the 
browser.   
- [✅] All exercises have been completed as per the 
requirements and pushed to the respective GitHub repository.
